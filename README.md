# Smart Dynamic Form

This project is a dynamic form with 20 input fields, built in React. 
It uses a single validation function for all fields to save time and code.

## How I solved the task
- Created an array of fields and mapped them to inputs.
- Used one generic function `validateField()` for all validations.
- Supports input, select, textarea, and radio types.
- Easy to add new fields without writing extra code.
